Drugs significantly impact brain function, altering crucial areas responsible for life-sustaining functions and driving the compulsive drug use characteristic of addiction. Long-term drug use leads to impaired brain functioning. The brain's communication system, involving neurons and neurotransmitters, is disrupted by drug use. Some drugs, like marijuana and heroin, mimic natural neurotransmitters, attaching to and activating neurons, but sending abnormal signals. Others, such as amphetamines and cocaine, cause excessive release of natural neurotransmitters or interfere with their recycling, amplifying or disrupting neural communication. This interference affects key brain regions: The basal ganglia, part of the brain's reward circuit, are over-activated by drugs, leading to euphoria. However, repeated drug exposure diminishes the circuit's sensitivity, making it difficult to experience pleasure from anything other than the drug. The extended amygdala, involved in stress, anxiety, irritability, and unease, becomes more sensitive with increased drug use. This motivates individuals to seek drugs to alleviate withdrawal discomfort, rather than for pleasure. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for complex cognitive functions, is also affected, though the specific impacts are not detailed in the provided text. The intense pleasure derived from drugs, amplified by large surges of dopamine, powerfully reinforces drug-seeking behavior. This process "teaches" the brain to prioritize drug use over healthier activities and goals. Environmental cues associated with drug use can trigger uncontrollable cravings, a learned response that can persist for years, even after long periods of abstinence. This phenomenon highlights how drugs create a more potent reward signal than natural rewards, akin to shouting compared to whispering, leading to addiction.
